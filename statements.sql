Consider a river system as a main river and all the tributary rivers that flow into it, and their respective tributary rivers and so on. Present a table that shows the names of the rivers of the longest branch(es)* of each river system and the total length of each shown branch, as well as the number of rivers in each and the rank of the number of rivers in the branch. Start from the rivers the Nile, Amazon, Yangtze, Rhein, Donau and Mississippi and explore from there. You are allowed to hard-code the names of those rivers.
